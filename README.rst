Installation
------------

Install [npm](https://npmjs.org/)

From this directory run ``npm install``.

Gratulations! You just angularized your project :)

From now you can call ``grunt`` to compile ``src/static/coffee/*.coffee`` to ``src/static/js/app/*.js``
alternatively, ``grunt watch`` starts watching ``src/static/coffee`` for changes.


Create your coffee scripts in src/static/coffee.
